# **PixelPet**

Welcome to **PixelPet** — my digital playground for leveling up in modern front-end and back-end development while building something fun, charming, and maybe even a little addictive. 🐾

## **What is PixelPet?**

PixelPet started as a clone of Apple.com’s landing page — a clean, responsive design challenge — but quickly evolved into its own world. Now, it’s the home base for a growing cast of pixel-perfect pets, and the testing ground for everything I’m learning along the way.

**Core tech so far:**

* **HTML5 + CSS3**: Flexbox, CSS Grid, and responsive layouts
* **CSS Magic**: Smooth animations, transitions, and theming
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic UI interactions and clean modular code
* **React**: Component-based design, state management, and reusable UI parts
* **Accessibility & Performance**: Semantic HTML and optimized loading
