# PixelPet â€“ (Apple.com's layout clone)

A front-end development practice project replicating the design and layout of Apple.com, reimagined for a fictional brand called **PixelPet**.  
This project is part of my **fast-paced 16-week front-end development roadmap**, and is intended to strengthen my skills in **HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid), and JavaScript DOM manipulation**.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this project is **skill mastery through applied practice**.  
Rather than following only tutorials, Iâ€™m building a real-world, design-focused website from scratch, forcing myself to solve layout and styling problems independently.  
Key objectives include:

- Mastering **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for responsive layouts.
- Learning **modern, semantic HTML** structure.
- Practicing **CSS organization** for large-scale pages.
- Gaining confidence in **JavaScript DOM events and interactivity**.
- Strengthening **problem-solving skills** by replicating or replacing complex UI components.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** â€“ Semantic structure & accessibility.
- **CSS3** â€“ Flexbox, Grid, responsive media queries, animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** â€“ DOM manipulation, event handling.
- **Version Control** â€“ Git & GitHub for tracking progress.
- **Live Preview** â€“ [GitHub Pages / Local server] for testing.

---

## Features Planned

- Fully responsive layout across devices.
- Interactive navigation menu.
- Smooth animations for hover and click events.
- High-quality brand assets (PixelPet logos & images).
- Clean, well-commented code for future reference.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I will:

1. Be more confident with **responsive layouts**.
2. Write **cleaner CSS** and reduce duplication.
3. Understand **positioning and spacing** at a deeper level.
4. Build reusable **JavaScript functions** for UI interactions.
5. Develop a stronger eye for **UI/UX details**.

## Why PixelPet?

Instead of simply cloning Apple.com exactly, Iâ€™m adapting it into a **fictional tech brand** â€” PixelPet â€” to make it my own.  
This allows me to **practice design adaptation**, not just blind replication, which is a key real-world skill for freelance and client work.
