# PixelPet

Welcome to **PixelPet** ‚Äî my personal project playground for mastering modern front-end development, with a splash of backend magic on the horizon!  
Right now, PixelPet is a lively, interactive landing page inspired by Apple.com‚Äôs sleek design ‚Äî but with pixelated charm and personality all its own.

---

## What Is PixelPet?

PixelPet started as a fun exercise to clone Apple.com‚Äôs landing page layout and styling by hand, getting hands-on with:

- Responsive design using **Flexbox** and CSS Grid  
- **CSS animations and transitions** for smooth, eye-catching interactions  
- Building UI components with **React** and managing state  
- Modern JavaScript best practices learned through [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)

---

## What You‚Äôll See Now

- A fully responsive landing page with neat navigation, clickable buttons, and animated hover states  
- Smooth theme toggling between light and dark modes with animated transitions  
- React components that make the UI modular and easy to update  
- Clean, semantic HTML and accessible markup for usability

## What‚Äôs Coming Next?

This project is a work in progress ‚Äî here‚Äôs the roadmap for PixelPet‚Äôs upcoming features and learning milestones:

- [ ] Add **backend functionality** with Node.js and Express to store and manage user data (think ‚Äúcreate your own pixel pet‚Äù!)  
- [ ] Expand React components with routing, forms, and dynamic data fetching  
- [ ] Implement user authentication so players can save and personalize their pets  
- [ ] Build features like pet collections, leveling up, and interactive environments  
- [ ] Continue polishing the UI with more animations, accessibility improvements, and responsive tweaks

## Why PixelPet?

This project is my way of combining what I‚Äôve learned in front-end development with practical backend skills ‚Äî all while building something playful and potentially fun. It‚Äôs not just a project, it‚Äôs a journey, and PixelPet might someday become a real site!
